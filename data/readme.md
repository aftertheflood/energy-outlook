## Definitions

### Data
Unless noted otherwise, data definitions are based on the BP Statistical Review of World Energy
Primary energy comprises commercially-traded fuels, and excludes traditional biomass
The primary energy values of nuclear, hydro and electricity from renewable sources have been derived by calculating the equivalent amount of fossil fuel required to generate the same volume of electricity in a thermal power station assuming a conversion efficiency of 38% (a global average for thermal power generation)
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expressed in terms of real Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) at 2010 prices

### Sectors
Transport includes energy used in road, marine, rail and aviation
Industry includes energy combusted in manufacturing; construction; the energy industry including pipeline transport; and for transformation processes outside of power generation
Non-combusted includes fuel that is used as a feedstock to create materials such as petrochemicals, lubricant and bitumen
Buildings includes energy used in residential and commercial building, plus agriculture, fishing and IEA’s non-specified sector “Other”
Power includes inputs into power generation (including combined heat and power plants)

### Regions
OECD is approximated as North America plus Europe plus OECD Asia
China refers to the Chinese Mainland
Other Asia includes all countries and regions in non-OECD Asia excluding mainland China and India

### Fuels, carbon and materials
Oil unless noted otherwise includes: crude; natural gas liquids (NGLs); gas-to-liquids (GTLs); coal-to-liquids (CTLs); condensate; and refinery gains
Liquids includes all of oil plus biofuels
Renewables unless otherwise noted includes wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and biofuels and excludes large-scale hydro
Non-fossils includes renewables, nuclear and hydro
References to carbon emissions consider only CO2 emissions from fuel combustion
Plastics includes synthetic fibres
